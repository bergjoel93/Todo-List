# Todo List

Frontend environment for building JavaScript applications. 
What's left to do: 
* We've started semi fresh. 
* Create a module called createTaskForm which will be responsible for creating the new task form html. 
* Create a renderNewTaskOverlay. This will be responsible for rendering the new task form and overaly to the UI. 
* Create handleNewTaskUserInput, which will handle the user input from the form. 
* Create new module updateTaskList, which will handle updating the task list


///////
* Got checkboxes working, kind of.... handlecomplete isn't working well. Also, we can't uncheck something. So figure that out. 
* Add a completed section below Today and All Tasks that appears only if there are completed tasks. Make it a drop down. 
* Add logic so that a caution message appears if title is a duplicate within the task list. in renderAddTask.js
* Add a way to delete/edit tasks - Add small icon section to right of task that appears when you hover over it. 
* Make tasks complet-able
* Project Stuff/Creation
